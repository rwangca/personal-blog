title: Hello Eleventy

> [Eleventy is a simpler static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/)

I've been reading about eleventy and took the plunge this weekend. I previously used Jekyll and have found eleventy to be just as straight-forward and quick to hit the ground running. I like that we have the freedom and flexibility to choose template languages, I think it's a bonus that we can easily migrate to another template engine should we choose to. I found the [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) extremely helpful and tested out a few before I settled on something miminalist. üçæ Cheers to the fresh new look, I'm really excited to get some content on here. If you've been on the fence about trying this static site generator, I'd take a dive and test it out, you can get up and running within day.
