> Eleventy the static site generator

I've been reading about eleventy and took the plunge this weekend. I previously used Jekyll and have found eleventy to be just as straight-forward and quick to hit the ground running. I like that we have the freedom and flexibility to choose template language and it's a bonus that we can easily migrate to another template engine if we change our minds down the road. There are a lot of impressive base templates which you can find here in the [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) section. üçæ Cheers to the fresh new look, I'm really excited to get some content on here. If you've been on the fence about trying this static site generator, it's one git clone and npm install away. Not to mention that netlify makes is super accessible to deploy, I'm still amazed it takes less than 2 minutes each time.
